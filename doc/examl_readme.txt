EXaML analysis README

Goal: infer broad rbcL tree including all Moorea and Tahiti species to use for dating

Data
rbcL_broad: alignment (phy) including all rbcL sequences from genbank curated by Weston Testo, plus one seq/species for Moorea and Tahiti species. Includes outgroup (lycophytes and angios)
	
Notes 
2015-08-25: removed Vandenboschia_speciosa from rbcL_broad. This seems to be a mislabeled sequence from genbank (blasts to Cyrtomium)

other weird seqs to check: Polypodium_vulgare (coming out in angios)
