2015-08-22 raxml_pthreads on rbcL_broad. job started, but ran out of time (1 day limit).

2015-08-22 examl_batch on rbcL_broad. finished.

2015-08-25 examl_batch on rbcL_broad (removed V. speciosa bad seq). Submitted, never started.

2015-08-25 r8s on three different nexus files in interactive mode. Get errors from r8s each time.

2015-08-26 create pathd8 folder. can't get it to run yet.

2015-08-26 update rbcL_broad.phy alignment: removed bad seqs including Vandenboschia speciosa and Polypodium vulgare. keep backup of old rbcL_broad.phy as rbcL_broad.phy.OLD

2015-08-26 raxml_pthreads on rbcL_broad (new version). increase number of nodes from 10 to 16, mem from 20,000 to 32,000 mb (2,000 mb per node), amount of processing time from 1d to 7d. change to general partition. first run interactive to test.
FAILED. For some reason, original rbcL_broad.phy was missing from data folder. try again...

2015-08-30 same as above - raxml_pthreads on rbcL_broad (new version). put rbcL_broad.phy back in data folder, trying again. Note - now keeping all scripts in bin/ and calling from date directory in bin (don't copy into bin/date folder)

2015-08-31  Added new blast.sh script to bin, added trnHpsbA trimmed library fasta file and unknown gameto seqs to data.
created blast id library for trnHpsbA
ran blast on clean gameto trnHpsbA

2015-09-01 Running digital rads (interactive) again (ran out of time last time). 
run in "~/Analysis/drad/2015-09-01" (not in "moorea", which has git repository)
keep a copy of digitalrads.sh script and the final output file only in "~/Analysis/moorea/bin/2015-09-01"

2015-09-03 digital rads failed (ran out of time). Talked with Jeff, turns out Ceratopteris genome has nearly 1 million contigs, which was producing way too many files.
Jeff rewrote script so that it takes fasta with seqs on one line each, doesn't make all those files. Try again with this version later.
Ran blast.sh on rbcL data. Needed to reformat input gameto fasta because a few seqs had (JNG1086, JNG 1087) had ? instead of n.
Eventually get digital rads script to work using new version of python script.

2015-09-09 created blast db using ceratopteris draft genome. Run digitalrads_blast.sh using radtags produced by digitalrads.py. Next, need to parse this output with R script to find how many radtags hit multiple contigs.

2015-09-28 installed PATHd8 locally in bin folder. Ran PATHd8 on rbcL_broad following pathd8_interactive.sh.

2015-10-02 get PATHd8 working normally (have to use new module system). Run PATHd8 on rbcL_broad with lycophytes trimmed
Also run on rbcL_broad, no lycophytes, no node names

2015-10-04 ran remote blast on "no fern match" sequences from R script
