Under CAT the memory required by ExaML for storing CLVs and tip vectors will be
555798012 bytes
542771 kiloBytes
530 MegaBytes
0 GigaBytes


Under GAMMA the memory required by ExaML for storing CLVs and tip vectors will be
2172664956 bytes
2121743 kiloBytes
2072 MegaBytes
2 GigaBytes

Please note that, these are just the memory requirements for doing likelihood calculations!
To be on the safe side, we recommend that you execute ExaML on a sysytem with twice that memory.
