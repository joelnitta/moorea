BEAST settings 2015-10-02

for all versions, set starting tree to pathd8 tree, trim out lycophytes

version 1:

site model: GTR
gamma category count: 4
estimate shape
estimate substitution rate
relaxed clock lognormal
estimate clock rate
speciation model: birth death
	birthDeath.meanGrowthRate =  uniform between 1 and 100 (Rothfels and Schuettpelz 2014)
	birthDeath.relativeDeathRate = uniform between 0 and 2 (Rothfels and Schuettpelz 2014)
ucld.mean
	set to exponential, mean=3 (apparently the mean rate from pathd8)
	lower bound 0
all calibration points exponential, mean=1, offset = age of fossil

version 2: same as above, but don't constrain any calibration point to be monophyletic

version 3: same as above, but:
	speciation model is yule on default values
	don't constrain any calibration point to be monophyletic
